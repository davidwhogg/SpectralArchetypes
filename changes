We would like to thank the referee for his/her useful comments on our paper. We tried to take into account all of them and revise our manuscript. All the changes are highlighted with bold fonts in the new version. Please find below our answers to all the comments:

REFEREE: My main concern lies in the comparison of HMF with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a popular technique for representing spectral subspaces in the community. In the Introduction (S1), the authors made a big effort to discuss the advantages and drawbacks of PCA, with the latter (1) being agnostic about the source of variance; (2) offering a linear subspace only; and (3) using no prior information (and potentially would lead to negative fluxes in a reconstructed spectrum). The HMF takes into account the observed flux uncertainties in modeling the spectral sample, but that does not qualify it as a way "to know the astrophysical processes that generate the data prior to the addition of observational noise" (S1, P5, last sentence). I urge the authors to make clearer the overall comparison.

AUTHORS: We agree with the referee that this sentence was misleading. What we wanted to say here was that having a knowledge of the amount of the variance that is caused by the observational noise can put us one step closer to physically meaningful results. We rephrased this sentence. We are hoping that the rest of the text regarding HMF-PCA comparison is not confusing. It was a little difficult to be more detailed on this in the introduction since the HMF method has not been presented yet, but we are hoping that it is quite clear in the conclusions section.

REFEREE: In S1 P3, the authors commented that it's often a mistake to interpret physically the data-driven models without theoretical justification. Is the theoretical justification the probabilistic justification (in the objective function), if I understand correctly? Do all data-driven models (PCA, HMF, and others) suffer from this problem - i.e., does the probabilistic justification (as in HMF) guarantee a correct physical interpretation? Please clarify.

AUTHORS:  This is a common problem for all the data-driven methods, i.e. one should be very careful when trying to physically interpret the output of data-driven methods. The output classes, eigenspectra etc that result from a data-driven method do not necessarily correspond to classes or components with physical meaning, since they usually result from the optimization of a probabilistic function that is not straightforward related to the underlying physical properties of the sources. We have added some comments in the text to make this point clearer.

REFEREE: In the Discussion (S6 P4), it was pointed out that perhaps the biggest advantage of HMF over PCA is its modeling of data uncertainties, which is instrumental for low S/N data. Certainly the innate PCA does not take data uncertainties into account, yet it will be useful to make the readers aware that there were PCA works (e.g., Boroson and Lauer, 2010) that addressed the issue on modeling low S/N spectra. BL10 successfully identified a BHB candidate, and other outliers, by using the PCA together with the estimated risk criterion. This result should be stated explicitly in S5.3.2.

AUTHORS: We added the comments and the reference suggested by the referee in S6 P4.

Less important issues:

REFEREE: In S1 and elsewhere: the non-linearity in spectral flux vs. underlying physical parameters was pointed out and addressed by Vanderplas & Connolly (2009) for galaxies and QSOs. Please reference.

AUTHORS: We added a sentence and the reference in S1 P6 for this issue.

REFEREE: In S1 P10 and elsewhere: the problem of missing data in spectra was addressed objectively by Connolly & Szalay (1999). There are also related discussions in Budavari et al. (2009).

AUTHORS: The two references have been added in S1 P10.

REFEREE: In S5.1, last paragraph: LRG spectra show very little variation - relative to what kind of object? For example, it will be useful to reference Yip et al. (2004) where the authors showed a large diversity in QSO spectra.

AUTHORS: We added a sentence in order to make more clear that the LRG spectra show little variation in comparison to spectra of other types of sources like QSOs. We also refer to the study by Yip et al. (2004).

REFEREE: In S5.1 P6: I am confused why Fig. 1 showed "HMF can achieve better modeling of spectra than PCA". Please clarify/correct.

AUTHORS: We added a sentence in the text here, in order to clarify this. What we meant is that for a given number of components HMF is achieving a smaller total x2 value in the training set than PCA. Since the logarithm of the likelihood is proportional to the chi-squared this means that HMF can achieve a higher likelihood. We hope that this is now clear in the text.

REFEREE: In S6 P5, it was pointed out that the HMF spectral bases comprise of small numbers of components. This result, I would imagine, depends on the training set in question (e.g., the rank of its subspace) for a given method. This information would be useful to the readers.

AUTHORS: We added a sentence in this paragraph to make clear that the minimum number of components depends on the training data.

REFEREE: Are the HMF basis spectra linearly independent, with and without the negativity constrain? Perhaps I miss it but I don't seem to find this information anywhere, which would be useful/interesting to readers.

AUTHORS: HMF (equation 4) in principle does not lead to components that are linearly independent. In order to produce such components we have implemented equations (10) which orthogonalize the HMF basis functions. Therefore when the non-negativity constraint is not applied the HMF components are linearly independent. This is not the case for the HMF with the non-negativity constraint, where as it is mentioned in the text above equation (17) the HMF components cannot be orthogonalized and therefore linear independence cannot be guaranteed. We added a sentence at this part of the text to make this clearer.

REFEREE: Should each panel in Fig. 7 (and the later plots) use a different wavelength range?

AUTHORS: Yes, the wavelength range in each case is defined by the common area between the SDSS spectrum and the 2 sets of components when moved at the zi and zn redshifts (please see equation 19). Therefore the larger the redshift, the smaller the wavelength coverage. We added a sentence for this issue in the caption of figure 7.

REFEREE: The spectral bases (Fig. 2) are too small to be visualized clearly.

AUTHORS: We enlarged the images in figure 2. We hope that now they are easier to be visualized.

12. I corrected the reference Roweis & Ghahramani to Roweis & Zourbin

13. I added a reference to Boroson & Lauer also at S1 P10 where we refer to studies that used PCA and patching of the data to treat the problem of missing data.

14. I added in the acknowledgments everyone that sent us an email after the paper was posted in the arXiv.

15. I added references to the papers by Wilson and the one in bioinformatics (at the place we are referencing the chemistry paper, even though I m not completely sure that the Wilson papers are completely relevant here, maybe the one of them fits better).

16. I added one comment based on the Malyshev's email about what we mean by convergence of our algorithm (at the end of S3 P3). However, I didn't mention anything about the discussion in that email regarding convergence and degeneracies.

17. I added a comment regarding the performance of diffusion K-means compared to standard K-means that was mentioned in Richards et al. I didn't add the comment about the SFHs because we have included so far only things we are planning to do, but maybe it will be good to add one more paragraph with other applications.
