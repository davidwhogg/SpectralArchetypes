For each spectrum, we generate $k+1$ mutually exclusive hypotheses:
The null hypothesis $S$ that the spectrum only has significant flux
coming from a single redshift $z_S$ determined by the \facility{SDSS}
pipeline, and $k$ hypotheses $D_j$ that the spectrum has significant
flux coming from two redshifts, $z_S$ and another redshift
$z_j>z_S+\epsilon$.  In the context of this very restricted universe
of hypotheses, the odds ratio for the null hypothesis is
\begin{equation}
O = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^k p(D_j|\fluxvec,I)}{p(S|\fluxvec,I)}
  = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^k p(\fluxvec|D_j,I)}{p(\fluxvec|S,I)}
  \,\frac{\sum_{j=1}^k p(D_j|I)}{p(S|I)} \quad,
\end{equation}
where the spectral flux data are represented by the vector $\fluxvec$,
and the symbol $I$ represents all of the prior information in the
problem, including but not limited to the hypothesis specification,
the wavelengths and uncertainties associated with the spectral flux
data, and any other knowledge that the investigator might have about
the hypotheses prior to any data analysis.
